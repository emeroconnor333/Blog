        <h2>How to Vision Board</h2>
        <h5>The Most Enjoyable Way of Making Your Dreams Become a Reality</h5>

            The first step to making a vision board. I was also looking forward to a trip to London which I decided to include so I could look forward to it more. I also encourage you to think about the kind of lifestyle you want to lead- do you want to practice slow living or be super productive? Personally, I wanted a mix; make consistent progress towards each of my goals while also being gentle to myself and feeling present.

            The next step is to go to Pinterest and find photos that reflect your goals and intentions (of course you can also cut pictures out of magazines and make a physical board!). I like to have a mix of quotes, places and people- bonus points for having a cohesive colour palette. Don’t just pick pictures because they’re aesthetically pleasing- each one should be meaningful to you. When you’ve been making vision boards for a while, you might find yourself saving pictures throughout the month so that when it gets to making the board you already have plenty on hand.
        </p>

            This step my favourite; putting the pictures together. I like to create a positive atmosphere by putting on my favourite playlist and grabbing a cup of tea and a blanket. It’s also a fun activity to do with friends as you can show them off to each other at the end. I usually use Canva to make my boards as it’s free and very intuitive to use. There’s also plenty of templates that you can just drag and drop images into (search ‘collage’ in templates). If you have a goal that you’re prioritising, make it the biggest and most centred image so that it’s the most eye-catching. Take your time in making it but don’t go overboard- it doesn’t have to be perfect.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Once your finished, put your board somewhere you’ll see it every day. This could mean setting it as your phone/ laptop background or printing it and putting it above your bed. The more you look at your board, the more you’ll be reminded of your goals and intentions so try to look at it daily as you’ll be more likely to integrate them into your day.

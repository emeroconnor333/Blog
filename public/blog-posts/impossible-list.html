        <h2>Impossible List</h2>
        <h5>Turning Dreams into Achievable Steps: The Power of an Impossible List</h5>
        <img src="../../images/impossible-list-quote.jpg" alt="" class="float-right">
        <h6>What is an impossible list?</h6>
        <p>
            An impossible list is like a bucket list, but with a twist—rather than jotting down grand, distant goals that you might never revisit, you create challenges that feel achievable and gradually build up. For example, instead of starting with “host an exhibition for a collection of my paintings” (especially since I don’t know how to paint yet), my first objective is “complete a painting course online.” From there, I’ll create new goals that progressively get bigger. The concept of an impossible list was created by YouTuber and author Jade Bowler, whose video I highly recommend for inspiration.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h6>My impossible list</h6>
        <p>There are two main reasons I’m sharing my list publicly. First, I hope to inspire you to create your own, as this approach has genuinely helped me achieve my goals. For instance, two years ago, one of my goals was to learn how to drive. My first step was to pass my theory test, which I added to my list. Once I accomplished that, I moved on to taking 12 driving lessons, and eventually, to pass my test (which I did!). The second reason I’m sharing my list is a bit more selfish—I want to increase my chances of actually achieving these goals. Studies show that sharing a goal with others makes you more likely to achieve it because you’re now accountable to those who know about it. So, thanks for being my accountability partner! If you notice items on my list not getting ticked off, feel free to nag me.</p>

        <h2>Summary: Feel Good Productivity</h2>
        <h5>The Guide on How to Do More of What Matters to You</h5>

            As an avid watcher of Ali Abdaal’s YouTube videos, I was delighted to hear that he was releasing a book. Ali started his channel while running his own business and in medical school so when it comes to productivity, he knows what he’s talking about. The book is split into three parts, energise, unblock and sustain, and how we can use these areas to make our time spent working more worthwhile and enjoyable.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Part 1, energise, tells us that bringing play, power and people into our tasks will make them much easier to do. Ali shows us how life can be treated as a game, you can increase your curiosity and not take things too seriously. Power refers to having a sense of autonomy over your work and Ali uses scientific studies to show that this increases our engagement. Finally, working with people motivates us and keeps up our energy levels.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Part 2, unblock, deals with procrastination, encouraging us to seek clarity, find courage and get started. By seeking clarity, we find out why we’re procrastinating, what goals we actually want to work towards and when we are going to start. The second blocker is fear; fear of failure and fear of being judged. Usually we blow things out of proportion and things aren’t really so bad. The final tip is to just get started. Once you’ve overcome the initial inertia, things get a whole lot easier.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Part 3, sustain, focuses on how we can continue to keep up our energy and motivation. There are three ways of avoiding burnout; stop overcommitting, resist meaningless distraction and take regular breaks. He stresses the importance of allowing yourself to just switch off.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The final chapter is encouragement to experiment with what works for you, and stick with that once you find it as your work should always be something you enjoy.
